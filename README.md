THIS PROJECT IS A SIMPLE EMBEDDED SYSTEM USING AN AURDINO MICROCONTROLLER THAT COUNTS THE NUMBER OF TIMES A  PUSH BUTTON IS PRESSED.I WROTE THE CODE FOR THE DEBOUNCING THE BUTTON TO ENSURE TO GET A ACCURATE COUNTING.EACH ACCURATE COUNTING WAS SHOWN IN THE SERIAL MONITOR.
I USED THE COMPONENTS AURDINO,PUSH BUTTON,JUMPER WIRES,BREAD BOARD ETC.I HAVE  PERFORMED THE GIVEN TASK IN TINKERCAD CIRCUITS, AN ONLINE PALTFORM THAT ALLOWS CIRCUIT DESIGN AND AURDINO CODE SIMULATION WITHOUT PHYSICAL HARDWARE.FOR DOING THE TASK  I GOT THE INFORMATION FROM MATERIALS AND GOOGLE.THESE HEPLED ME UNDERSTAND DEBOUNCING TECHNIQUES,HOW PUSH BUTTONS FUNCTION AND HOW TO DISPLAY OUTPUT IN AURDINO ENVIRONMENT.
THE CIRCUIT WAS DESIGNED BY CONNECTING THE PUSH BUTTON TO A DIGITAL INPUT PIN ON THE AURDINO,WITH A PULL DOWN RESISTOR TO KEEP THE INPUT LOW WHEN THE BUTTON IS NOT PRESSED.WHEN THE BUTTON IS PRESSED, THE PIN GOES HIGH,AND THE CODE DETECTS THIS CHANGE TO INCREMENT THE COUNTER.HERE THE COUNT IS SHOWN IN THE SERIAL MONITOR.
I HAVE INCLUDED THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM,AURDINO CODE,SCREENSHOT OF THE COUNT IN THE GITHUB REPOSITORY.THE IMAGE OF THE OUTPUT WAS SHOWN IN THE BELOW.
